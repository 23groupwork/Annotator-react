MergeSort is a classical Divide-and-Conquer algorithm, and, QuickSort is very much like a Divide-and-Conquer algorithm (although it doesnâ€™t divide the problem into equal-sized subproblems). The problem we discussed about counting inversions in permutations used a Divide-and-Conquer method to solve it (namely, a modification of the MergeSort algorithm).",
